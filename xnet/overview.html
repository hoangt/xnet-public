<h1>XNet version 0.1</h1>
<P>
<b>XNet</b> is a suite of Java software tools developed for creating discrete event simulations 
and running evolutionary algorithms. While these tools are designed to work well together, they 
are split into distinct packages so that they may also be used independently. The main packages are:
<dl>
	<dt>
		<a href="#xsim">XSim</a> 
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A discrete event simulation library. Simulations are modeled as a set of Components that pass state 
		to one another and update themselves on command according to the phases of a defined Clock.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<a href="#xevolution">XEvolution</a> 
	</dt>
	<dd>	
		An evolutionary algorithm library. Evolution is modeled as a set of Populations made up of individual 
		Genomes that are transformed, evaluated, and culled from one generation to the next.
	</dd>
</dl> 

Other <b>XNet</b> packages either provide supporting functionality or specialized extensions which are 
useful in particular fields. For instance, there is an <a href="#xart">XART</a> package that provides an 
implementation of an ART3 network for use with XSim, and an <a href="#xneat">XNEAT</A> package 
that provides an implementation of the NEAT evolutionary algorithm for use with XEvolution. The 
<a href="#xbatch">XBatch</a> package permits XSim simulations to be run in batches, useful for evaluating 
the simulation performance of phenotypes for fitness purposes during evolution.
